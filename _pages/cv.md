Education
======
* M.S. in Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, 2024-
* B.S. in School of Astronautics, Beihang University, 2020-2024

Study experience
======
* Research on Sparse View 3D Reconstruction Based on Neural Radiance Fields
- Introduced prior knowledge and creative reasoning capabilities into sparse view reconstruction technology through a diffusion model, enabling object reconstruction with only three input images.
- Analyzed the mechanism behind the degradation phenomenon of 3D reconstruction from sparse views, and proposed density peak regularization to alleviate the floating object effect.
- Proposed a dataset for 3D reconstruction, Kun-100, which contains 111 real images of the target object captured under the same lighting conditions.

* Hybrid Event-Enhanced Image De-occlusion
- Authors: Ning Gao, Feice Huang, Lei Zhang, Xiaoyan Luo, Yue Deng  
- Published in CITA 2023  
- Proposed an innovative method based on the fusion of event streams and image frames, significantly improving the efficiency and performance of dense foreground occlusion removal and target reconstruction by introducing a spiking neural network encoder, Time Channel Attention (TCA) blocks, and General Repair Blocks (GRB).  
- The project is open-source and available at: [https://github.com/feice-huang/event-enhanced-deocc](https://github.com/feice-huang/event-enhanced-deocc)
  
Skills
======
- Proficient in using the Linux operating system, programming languages such as Python and C, and the PyTorch deep learning framework.  
- Passed the CET-6 (College English Test Band 6), with extensive experience in reading English literature and academic paper writing.
